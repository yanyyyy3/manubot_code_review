    "abstract": "<jats:p>Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The website Sci-Hub enables users to download PDF versions of scholarly articles, including many articles that are paywalled at their journal's site. Sci-Hub has grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub's database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://greenelab.github.io/scihub\">https://greenelab.github.io/scihub</ext-link> allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable.",

    "abstract": "  Introduced eighty years ago, the Fermi pseudopotential has been a powerful concept in multiple fields of physics. It replaces the detailed shape of a potential by a delta-function operator multiplied by a parameter giving the strength of the potential. For Cartesian dimensions $d>1$, a regularization operator is necessary to remove singularities in the wave function. In this study, we develop a Fermi pseudopotential generalized to $d$ dimensions (including non-integer) and to non-zero wavenumber, $k$. Our approach has the advantage of circumventing singularities that occur in the wave function at certain integer values of $d$ while being valid arbitrarily close to integer $d$. In the limit of integer dimension, we show that our generalized pseudopotential is equivalent to previously derived $s$-wave pseudopotentials. Our pseudopotential generalizes the operator to non-integer dimension, includes energy ($k$) dependence, and simplifies the dimension-dependent coupling constant expression derived from a Green's function approach. We apply this pseudopotential to the problem of two cold atoms ($k\\to0$) in a harmonic trap and extend the energy expression to arbitrary dimension. ",
